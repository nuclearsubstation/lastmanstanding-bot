lastmanstanding-bot
===================

A simple IRC bot that can be used for regaining control during/after a netsplit.
To run for the first time, change your lastmanstanding/bin/Debug/config.cfg to suit your needs, then (if on *nix, ./lastmanstanding.exe, if on Windows, navigate the the directory and double-click).
Some text should appear, and about 15 seconds later, the bot will join the specified channel.
If you would like to edit the code, open lastmanstanding.sln in MonoDevelop, or in Visual Studio C# Express (not tested on Visual Studio non-express), compile and run.
